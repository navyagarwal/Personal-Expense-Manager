# Personal Expense Manager
 
I created this project for managing my personal finances when I joined college.

It uses the concepts of Object Oriented Programming.

The back end is built using a SQL database with multiple tables. It is connected to the Java application using JDBC.
The front end is a graphical user interface that consists of 3 Java Swing frames:
1. HomePage - To add new expenses
2. Categories page - To add new expense categories
3. Spendings page - To review periodic spending
